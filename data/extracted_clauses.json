            "(3) If floor joists span the full width of the building without support, lintel spans shall be reduced by 15% for \u201cRoof, ceiling and 1 storey\u201d, by 20% for \u201cRoof, ceiling and 2 storeys\u201d, and by 25% for \u201cRoof, ceiling and 3 storeys\u201d.",
            "(4) For ends of lintels fully supported by walls, provide minimum bearing length of 38 mm for lintel spans up to 3 m, or minimum bearing length of 76 mm for lintel spans greater than 3 m.",
            "(5) Spans for 0.6 m tributary width are calculated for lintels in end walls that support only a 0.6 m width of roof and ceiling, but do not support roof joists, roof rafters or roof trusses.",
            "(6) Lintel spans are calculated based on a maximum floor joist, roof joist or rafter span of 4.9 m and a maximum roof truss span of 9.8 m.  Lintel spans may be increased by 5% if rafter and joist spans are not more than 4.3 m and roof truss spans are not more than 8.6 m.  Spans may be increased by 10% if rafter and joist spans are not more than 3.7 m and roof trusses are not more than 7.4 m.",
