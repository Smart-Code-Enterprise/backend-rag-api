OS1 Fire Safety An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the design or construction of the building, a person in or adjacent to the building will be exposed to an unacceptable risk of injury due to fire. The risks of injury due to fire addressed in this Code are those caused by\u2014 OS1.1 \u2013 fire or explosion occurring OS1.2 \u2013 fire or explosion impacting areas beyond its point of origin OS1.3 \u2013 collapse of physical elements due to a fire or explosion OS1.4 \u2013 fire safety systems failing to function as expected OS1.5 \u2013 persons being delayed in or impeded from moving to a safe place during a fire emergency OS2 Structural Safety An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the design or construction of the building, a person in or adjacent to the building will be exposed to an unacceptable risk of injury due to structural failure. The risks of injury due to structural failure addressed in this Code are those caused by\u2014 OS2.1 \u2013 loads bearing on the building elements that exceed their loadbearing capacity OS2.2 \u2013 loads bearing on the building that exceed the loadbearing properties of the supporting medium OS2.3 \u2013 damage to or deterioration of building elements OS2.4 \u2013 vibration or deflection of building elements OS2.5 \u2013 instability of the building or part thereof OS2.6 \u2013 collapse of the excavation OS3 Safety in Use An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the design or construction of the building, a person in or adjacent to the building will be exposed to an unacceptable risk of injury due to hazards. The risks of injury due to hazards addressed in this Code are those caused by\u2014 OS3.1 \u2013 tripping, slipping, falling, contact, drowning or collision OS3.2 \u2013 contact with hot surfaces or substances OS3.3 \u2013 contact with energized equipment OS3.4 \u2013 exposure to hazardous substances OS3.5 \u2013 exposure to high levels of sound from fire alarm systems OS3.6 \u2013 persons becoming trapped in confined spaces OS3.7 \u2013 persons being delayed in or impeded from moving to a safe place during an emergency (see Note A-2.2.1.1.(1)) 2-2 Division A National Building Code of Canada 2020 Volume 1 \u00a9 His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 \u00a9 Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi du chef du Canada, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022"
